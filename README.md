# TradeOut

## Description

Conducting transactions in an online marketplace can be risky, and, unfortunately, scams and falsely advertised products are quite common. TradeOut is a platform that gives people greater transaction security by providing a quick and simple way to generate a digital contract between buyer and seller. Whether youâ€™re the buyer or the seller, in TradeOut you can:
- Initiate a contract for a transaction, including uploading item images
- Send the contract to the other party
- Sign the contract once you agree with the terms
- Always access a copy of the final, signed contract
- View all accepted, pending, and declined contracts

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com)
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [PDFMake](http://pdfmake.org/#/)

## Installation

1. Create a new database named `tradeout`, and execute the queries from `database.sql` to create the needed tables. 
2. Within a code editor, open a terminal window and install the dependencies by running: `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file with values for the following variables:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=random string containing more than eight characters

  SENDGRID_API_KEY=key provided with SendGrid account
  SENDGRID_EMAIL=verified sender email

  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=access key id from AWS
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret access key from AWS
  AWS_REGION=your AWS region
  S3_BUCKET_NAME=your AWS S3 bucket name
  ```
4. Note: [This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGYeYJpRWPM) by Sam Meech-Ward can be referenced to create the S3 bucket with correct access levels.
5. Run `npm run server` to start the server in one terminal window. Open a second terminal window, and run `npm run client` to start the client. The application will open at `localhost:3000/#/dashboard` in the browser. TradeOut was tested and designed for compatibility with Google Chrome. 

## Usage

### Registering

1. To register as a new user, click `Register` and enter an email, legal name, and password. 

### Logging In

1. To log in, enter the email and password associated with the account and click `Log In`. 

### Creating a Contract

1. To create a contract, click `New Contract` from the Dashboard. Select `Buyer` or `Seller` and click `Next`.
2. Within Create New Contract, enter the required informaton in the fields marked with a `*` and any other relevant information. Click `Choose File` to upload an image of the item being purchased or sold. Type the signature in the signature field. Click `Review Contract` to proceed. 
3. Review the contract details. Make any changes by clicking `Edit Contract Details` or proceed by clicking `Recipient Contact Information`. 
4. Within Send To Recipient, enter the email address of the other party in the contract. Click `Generate Contract Token` to generate a unique key that the recipient will receive to be able to securely view the contract. 
5. Click `Create Contract and Send to Recipient` to send an email to the recipient letting them know a contract is pending. 

### Receiving a Contract

2. Clicking `Accept` requires an account and will navigate to Registration. Once registered, the contract appears in the Dashboard.

### Accepting or Declining a Contract

1. Clicking a contract card from the Dashboard shows its details. If a contract is pending and awaiting an action, a signature field and buttons will appear at the bottom of Contract Details. 
2. To accept the terms of a contract, type the signature in the signature field and click `Sign and Finalize Contract`. The contract will then appear under the Accepted heading in the Dashboard.
3. To decline a contract, click `Decline`. The contract will then appear under the Declined heading in the Dashboard.
